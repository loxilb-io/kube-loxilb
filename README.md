## What is kube-loxilb ?

[kube-loxilb](https://github.com/loxilb-io/kube-loxilb) is [loxilb](https://github.com/loxilb-io/loxilb)'s implementation of kubernetes service load-balancer spec which includes support for load-balancer class, advanced IPAM (shared or exclusive), lb services on multus pods etc. kube-loxilb runs as a deloyment set in kube-system namespace. 

## How is kube-loxilb different from loxi-ccm ?

Another loxilb component known as [loxi-ccm](https://github.com/loxilb-io/loxi-ccm) also provides implementation of kubernetes load-balancer spec but it runs as a part of cloud-provider and provides load-balancer life-cycle management as part of it. If one does not need a cloud-provider or wants to integrate loxilb with their existing cloud-provider, one can use or include loxi-ccm as a part of it. If not kube-loxilb is the right component to use.

kube-loxilb is a standalone implementation of kubernetes load-balancer spec which does not depend on cloud-provider. It runs as a kube-system deployment and provisions load-balancer based on load-balancer class. It only acts on load-balancers for the LB classes that is provided by itself. This also allows us to have different load-balancers working together in the same K8s environment.

## How to use kube-loxilb ?

1.Make sure loxilb docker is downloaded and installed properly. One can follow guides [here](https://loxilb-io.github.io/loxilbdocs/run/) or refer to various other [documentation](https://loxilb-io.github.io/loxilbdocs/#how-to-guides)

2.Download the loxilb config yaml :

```
wget https://github.com/loxilb-io/kube-loxilb/raw/main/manifest/kube-loxilb.yaml
```

3.Modify arguments as per user's needs :
```
args:
        - --loxiURL=http://12.12.12.1:11111
        - --externalCIDR=123.123.123.1/24
        #- --externalSecondaryCIDRs=124.124.124.1/24,125.125.125.1/24
        #- --externalCIDR6=3ffe::1/96
        #- --monitor
        #- --setBGP=65100
        #- --extBGPPeers=50.50.50.1:65101,51.51.51.1:65102
        #- --setRoles
        #- --setLBMode=1
        #- --setUniqueIP=false
```

The arguments have the following meaning :    
- loxiURL : API server address of loxilb. This is the docker IP address loxilb docker of Step 1. If unspecified, kube-loxilb assumes loxilb is running in-cluster mode and autoconfigures this.
- externalCIDR : CIDR or IPAddress range to allocate addresses from. By default address allocated are shared for different services(shared Mode)
- externalCIDR6 : Ipv6 CIDR or IPAddress range to allocate addresses from. By default address allocated are shared for different services(shared Mode)   
- monitor : Enable liveness probe for the LB end-points (default : unset)    
- setBGP : Use specified BGP AS-ID to advertise this service. If not specified BGP will be disabled. Please check [here](https://github.com/loxilb-io/loxilbdocs/blob/main/docs/integrate_bgp_eng.md) how it works.
- extBGPPeers : Specifies external BGP peers with appropriate remote AS
- setRoles : If present, kube-loxilb arbitrates loxilb role(s) in cluster-mode
- setLBMode : 0, 1, 2   
  0 - default (only DNAT, preserves source-IP)       
  1 - onearm (source IP is changed to load balancerâ€™s interface IP)     
  2 - fullNAT (sourceIP is changed to virtual IP)    
- setUniqueIP : Allocate unique service-IP per LB service (default : false)   
- externalSecondaryCIDRs: Secondary CIDR or IPAddress ranges to allocate addresses from in case of multi-homing support    

4. Apply the following :
```
kubectl apply -f kube-loxilb.yaml
```

5. The above should make sure kube-loxilb is successfully running. Check kube-loxilb is running :

```
kubectl get pods -A | grep kube-loxilb
```


6. Finally to create service LB, we can use and apply the following template yaml :   
(<b>Note</b> -  Check <b>*loadBalancerClass*</b> and other <b>*loxilb*</b> specific annotation)   
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: iperf-service
  annotations:
    # If there is a need to do liveness check from loxilb
    loxilb.io/liveness: "yes"
    # Specify LB mode - one of default, onearm or fullnat 
    loxilb.io/lbmode: "default"
    # Specify loxilb IPAM mode - one of ipv4, ipv6 or ipv6to4 
    loxilb.io/ipam: "ipv4"
    # Specify number of secondary networks for multi-homing
    # Only valid for SCTP currently
    # loxilb.io/num-secondary-networks: "2 
spec:
  loadBalancerClass: loxilb.io/loxilb
  selector:
    what: perf-test
  ports:
    - port: 55001
      targetPort: 5001
  type: LoadBalancer
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: iperf1
  labels:
    what: perf-test
spec:
  containers:
    - name: iperf
      image: eyes852/ubuntu-iperf-test:0.5
      command:
        - iperf
        - "-s"
      ports:
        - containerPort: 5001
```
Users can change the above as per their needs.

7. Verify LB service is created
```
kubectl get svc
```
